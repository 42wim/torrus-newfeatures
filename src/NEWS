20-JUL-2006: Torrus release 1.0.4

This is a major release with many new features.

In this release:

-- SNMP Version 3 support in Devdiscover and SNMP collector.

-- Usage reports for billing. Including 95% percentile reports.
   More details at http://torrus.org/reporting_setup.pod.html

-- Various improvements in SNMP discovery engine and new equipment
   vendor support

-- Improved monitor notifications. New parameter: "severity"
   and new action "action_notify".

-- New torrus-siteconfig.pl variables to improve WebUI customization



02-AUG-2005: Torrus release 1.0.3

This is a minor bugfix release. Unreachable device handling is improved, and
also there's a possibility to specify extra Perl library path in ./configure


27-JUL-2005: Torrus release 1.0.2

The new release requires one additional Perl module to be
installed: Date::Parse. You can install it from CPAN by using the command:
  perl -MCPAN -e 'install Date::Parse'

In this release:

-- Unreachable SNMP devices handling has significantly improved.
   The default unreachable timeout is set to 6 hours.

-- Support for the new mod_perl 2.0 layout.

-- New OID in TORRUS-MIB: torrusMonitorDesc, for easier processing of
   SNMP traps.

-- ./configure checks if the user "torrus" exists in the system

-- New SNMP discovery parameters:
   RFC2863_IF_MIB::only-interfaces
   disable-snmpcollector

-- On the graph page, it is now possible to choose the date for displaying
   old statistics.

-- The Cisco CPUs are now managed by devdiscover's selectors.
   This allows you to add monitors to specific CPU graphs, and also add them
   to a tokenset.


21-JUN-2005: Torrus release 1.0.1

In this release:

-- SNMP errors are now handled better. See the User guide for more details.

-- New command line option for monitor: --delay. The init script
   launches the monitor with 20 minutes delay, to allow the collector
   update RRD files before monitoring them.

-- New devdiscover option: --fallback. It is useful in large production
   environments when it's important to have a device in the web interface
   even if it's turned off

-- Cisco DOCSIS templates now include Total, Active, and Registered
   modem quantities. RRD file structure has changed, so the graphs will
   start anew.

-- The meaning of $Torrus::Renderer::stylingProfileOverlay
   has changed: now it refers to a file name.


10-JUN-2005: Torrus release 1.0.0

In this release, compared to RRFW release 0.1.8:

-- New directory structure, with local configuration completely separated
   from the distribution files

-- Comand-line wrapper "torrus" for executing all commands, with short aliases
   ("dd" for "devdiscover" etc.)

-- Plugins may be easily added to existing installation

-- Relative file names in DDX files searched in the right directories

-- Discovery object selectors: the new way to customize the discovery results

-- New discovery modules:
   AxxessIT.pm: Cisco ONS 15300 SDH switches
   CiscoIOS_Docsis.pm: Cisco IOS DOCSIS specifics: upstream utilization and
     modem quantities
   BetterNetworks.pm: BetterNetworks EthernetBox sensors (temperature, humidity
     and so on)
   CiscoIOS_MacAccounting.pm: Automated discovery for Cisco MAC accounting.
     If applicable, MAC peers are associated with BGP peers.

-- Discovery modules improvements:
     IF-MIB indexing hints for unknown devices
     Docsis downstream utilization
     Selector actions for IF-MIB, Docsis, and temperature sensor objects
     Line cards and modules memory stats for modular Ciscso routers     

-- Improved performance of monitor daemon

-- extended example of DOCSIS monitors and 3-level alarms in
   xmlconfig/examples/docsis-monitors.xml

-- Renderer module improved for multi-CPU servers

-- Web interface improvements:
     Recursive directory view,
     Monitor names and comments diaplayed,
     Sizes of tokensets displayed
     Multiple overviews possible for a subtree

-- SO_RCVBUF is set explicitly in SNMP collector to sustain bursts of traffic

-- RRD files automatically moved in case of conflicts

-- ttproclist: the new utility for automating the DDX files generation

-- action_snmptrap now sends an optional severity parameter

-- New option for devdiscover: --forcebundle to write the bundle file
   even if errors occur

-- The init script is configurable by a separate configuration file.
   It also launches the monitors with 20 minutes delay if monitors
   are launched together with collectors
