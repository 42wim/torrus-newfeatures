Round Robin Database Framework
  
To do now:

-- Optimize DataAccess.pm and use cache
-- Option to expand directory view by default
-- Traceroute plugin (Gustavo Torres)
-- CDef Collector plugin (Christian Schnidrig)
-- Discovery support for HP ProCurve 2524 (Marc Haber provided snmpwalks)
-- Better Networks sensors discovery (Marc Haber)
-- Optionally show Admin info when authentication disabled
-- RRD Renderer to take CF from the view definition
-- Do we need a separate directory for user-defined styling?
-- Startup script that verifies database consistency at server boot
-- Collector that reports the BerkeleyDB stats
-- Sysedge ntregperf discovery optimization (Shawn)
-- Check RRD DS name length limit (19 bytes) and variable name limit (29 bytes)
-- Better handling of SNMP timeouts in devdiscover
-- MS-SQL SNMP support? (Shawn)
-- Discovery profiles (router, server, etc.) to limit the number of probes
-- Per-tree styling profiles (CSS, color schemas, company name and URL)
-- Describe IF-MIB discovery internals in doc/devdoc/devdiscover.pod
-- New utility to verify the installation files consistency (see below)
-- rrd-create-max for interface counters tunable in vendor modules
-- Backup snapshot of dynamic data (monitor status etc.)
-- Relative path in alias definition
-- "Remember me" login screen option
-- Graph colouring by monitor action
-- Session history display
-- Track changes of XML configurations (XML::Diff, cvs-alike?)
-- Translate parameters in monitor comments

Design work to do:

-- Design draft for custom indexing and quering
-- Develop a Concept of 95th percentile monthly reports
-- Reports generation (monthly, weekly etc.)
-- Write working draft for "collector-copy" datasource type

To do before Release 1.0.1:

-- Implement monitor escalation (devdoc/wd.monitor-escalation.pod)
-- BUG: template may add children to a leaf
-- Add more documentation to the existing XML
-- Document HTML templates
-- Web interface for ACL editing
-- Date selector in Web interface
-- CSV data export (new Renderer type)
-- Syslog logging

To do someday:

-- Discovery module for Cisco MAC accounting
-- Finish and test "RFC2662_ADSL_LINE" and "Paradyne" devdiscover modules
-- Backplane performance for Catalyst switches
-- BGP router statistics/MAC accounting/AS number lookup
-- VoIP dial peer statistics
-- Gradual highlighting for subtree listings
-- Tools for RRD files manipulation (adding/deleting DSes etc.)
-- Service uptime monitoring and reporting (devdoc/wd.uptime-mon.pod)
-- Distributed collector (devdoc/wd.distributed.pod)
-- Log files wraparound
-- Packaging for major OSes: RedHat, Debian, FreeBSD, Solaris, MacOS X (?)
-- rrdtool-1.1 font option (only after rrdtool 1.1.x is released)
-- navigation links to represent the network topology
-- Messaging (devdoc/wd.messaging.pod)
-- Tighter integration with OpenNMS and probably other systems
-- Several obscurity levels instead of hidden=yes/no

Similar functionality exists in cfengine, but I don't think it is 
applicable in this case.
Also tripwire.

I am not so worried about knowing if the loaded version is up to date 
based on a
stored version string.  Although that was my original thought.

I was thinking that the functionality of the "checkfiles" utility could 
just be as you
suggest an md5 sum.  Also, that md5 sum could be stored at 
initialization for the libraries
used in any long running process. The next initialization after a 
compile could verify
that the on disk sums have not changed.  Possibly to reload, alert or 
something.
