For installation instructions, see doc/install.txt or convert doc/install.pod
into a format of your preference.

Upgrade notes for all releases:

  After running "make install", the database and grapher cache should be
  cleaned manually. After that, XML recompilation is required:

    rm -f /usr/local/torrus-0.0/var/db/*
    rm -f /usr/local/torrus-0.0/var/cache/*
    /usr/local/torrus-0.0/bin/compilexml


Upgrade notes from previous releases to 0.0.9:

  XML configuration files are changed:
    datasources-def.xml and views.xml are deleted,
    and replaced with defaults.xml.

    defaults.xml is the file which is overwritten by "make install".
    The width-hint and height-hint are automatically calculated
    during the installation, by means of bin/rrd_getdim and bin/prepviews.

    Thus, when upgrading from previous release,
    you need to edit your torrus-siteconfig.pl, and manually remove
    datasources-def.xml and views.xml.

    Also the tokenset default views are moved from monitors.xml
    into defaults.xml. You need to manually update monitors.xml too.
