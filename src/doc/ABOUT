Round Robin Database Framework will be the universal
framework, or a frontend for Round-Robin Database (RRDtool).
Unlike the other frontends, it will prioritize the following
features:

-- Have flexible hierarchical configuration (like Cricket)
-- Wildcards in configuration for grouping the databases
   (or regexp'ed filenames?)
-- Arbitrary DS naming (Cricket understands only ds0, ds1...)
-- Monitor the RRDs according to specified rules, and automatically 
   create the summary page with the graphs of the RRDs showing 
   troubles (like Cricket's threshold monitoring. But it only creates 
   a list of DSes, and you have to go and see them by yourself).
-- Browse the available RRDs in a hierarchical manner (like Cricket, 
   but able to handle newly-created databases, like RRGrapher) 
-- no data collection at all. just monitoring and displaying the data 
   collected by someone else.
