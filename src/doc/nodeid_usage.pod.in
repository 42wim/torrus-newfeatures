This document explains the new concept of NodeID and ways of utilizing
it for better integration of Torrus into an OSS environment.


=head2 NodeID concept

Torrus 1.0.9 introduces a new parameter for datasource tree elements:
C<nodeid>. This parameter is not inherited from parent subtrees to child
subtrees or leaves. Also the XML configuration compiler verifies uniqueness
of its values across the whole tree.

The purpose of C<nodeid> is to provide persistent identifiers to the tree
elements. Unlike the token numbers, these identifiers are not changing between
re-compilations of the tree. Also unlike the path string, C<nodeid> would
stay the same if a network device changes its place in the tree topology.

By default, C<nodeid> value is composed of SNMP host name and device
component name, such as IF-MIB interface. It can also be easily adapted to
contain external identifiers, such as Asset ID or Service ID from some
external inventory database.

Once C<nodeid> values are put into the XML configuration (usually
SNMP discovery engine does it) and compiled into the configuration database,
they can be used for accessing the Torrus graphs from external systems.

The command-line utility C<torrus nodeid> helps searching through existing
NodeID values, and also renders the graphs on request.

Another quick way to find the NodeID value is to navigate to the desired
graph page and check the I<Bookmark> shortcut at the bottom of the page.
For the nodes where C<nodeid> is defined, the bookmark will use it instead of
the path in the datasource tree.



=head2 Host-based authentication

Many Torrus deployments have user authentication enabled. This makes it
complicated for other OSS systems to retrieve graphs from the Torrus rendering
engine.

Torrus 1.0.9 introduces host-based authentication: a special user
is created for requestor's IP address. The requestor specifies its unique
password in the URL as C<hostauth> parameter. Also the Torrus WebUI does not
send the session cookie back to the requestor.

This new feature makes it easy to display Torrus graphs inside user
self-service portals without giving direct access to the Torrus server.

For example, the following command adds the host 10.0.0.5 with password
"654321" to the I<admin> group:

  torrus acl --addhost=10.0.0.5 --hostpassword=654321 --addtogroup=admin

Then the following command executed from 10.0.0.5 would retrieve an
InOut_bps graph for the last 24 hours for a given interface on I<rtr01> router:

  wget -O graph.png \
    'http://torrus/main?nodeid=if//rtr01//GigabitEthernet0/1//inoutbit&view=last24h&hostauth=654321'


=head2 M-net plugin

Details of M-net plugin are explained in the plugin documentation.
The plugin interprets description strings on device network interfaces: 
it catches all key-value pairs of format I<key1=val1;key2=val2;...> and
performs various actions on them.

Now assume there's an external inventory system, and each network interface is
assigned a unique Asset ID. Our natural wish would be to use these asset IDs
in NodeID strings, instead of hostnames and interfaces. This way we are
secured against hardware changes and upgrades (assuming that Asset ID stays
unchanged).

In order to take advantage of M-Net plugin, the Asset ID values should be
configured in all interface descriptions, like follows:

  interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    description bw=200M; assetid=VPNLINK00055; ct=BC

In the example above, the interface description tells that this is a 200Mbps
link, connection type is Business Customer, and the unique link identifier is
I<VPNLINK00055>.  The format allows inserting extra spaces for better
readability.

In the corresponding Device Discovery XML (DDX) file, the following
parameters would be set:

  <host>
    <param name="snmp-host" value="rtr01.example.com"/>
    <param name="M_net::manage" value="yes"/>
    <param name="M_net::nodeid-prefix-key" value="assetid"/>
  </host>

As a result, after the SNMP discovery and XML compiler finish their work,
we get a number of NodeID values associated with this customer connection:
  
      assetid//VPNLINK00055
      assetid//VPNLINK00055//inbytes
      assetid//VPNLINK00055//indrops
      assetid//VPNLINK00055//inerr
      assetid//VPNLINK00055//inoutbit
      assetid//VPNLINK00055//inpackets
      assetid//VPNLINK00055//outbytes
      assetid//VPNLINK00055//outdrops
      assetid//VPNLINK00055//outerr
      assetid//VPNLINK00055//outpackets

The first NodeID refers to the interface-level subtree in Torrus
configuration, and all other values refer to the corresponding graphs
for this interface.

So, now the customer self-service portal would retrieve the input/output
summary graph with the following URL (wget woulld be certainly replaced by a
corresponding command in PHP or other Web programming language):

  wget -O graph.png \
    'http://torrus/main?nodeid=assetid//VPNLINK00055//inoutbit&view=last24h&hostauth=654321'

Of course, a number of additional view definitions could be created, in order
to create graphs of needed size and time span. Also, for example, a calendar
month's graph could be generated by specifying the followiong
parameters in the URL: C<NOW> or C<Gend> pointing to the beginning of
next month, and optionally C<Gstart> indicating the start of the time period.


=head2 Setting the host identifier

Alternatively to the technique explained above, the local OSS environment
could require some custom identifiers assigned to the network devices.
For example, CA Spectrum software uses its internal Model Handles to refer to
devices.

The discovery parameter C<nodeid-device> sets the string that would be used
in the host part of NodeID values:

  <host>
    <param name="snmp-host" value="rtr02.example.com"/>
    <param name="nodeid-device" value="0xC0FFEE"/>
  </host>
  
The resulting NodeID values would be based on "0xC0FFEE" string instead of
"rtr02.example.com":

  if//0xC0FFEE//GigabitEthernet0/1//inoutbit


=head2 Service-centric display: SIAM+Extopus

Service Inventory Abstraction Model (SIAM) is a new Perl library
available at CPAN. It is designed to be an abstraction interface between
enterprise-specific inventory database and various programs, such as
Torrus. SIAM is supposed to be used with an enterprise-specific driver
which maps the inventory data into SIAM objects and attributes.

Torrus 1.0.10 introduces a new plugin module: C<tp-siam>. It consists of
a command-line utility which generates DDX files from SIAM data, and a
DevDiscover module which tries to match the IF-MIB interface names in
SIAM against those on the network devices. The resulting configuration
contains I<nodeid> values imported from SIAM, and those values would be
typically based on service identifiers in the inventory database. Thus
the external programs can fetch Torrus data by using the
enterprise-specific service identifiers.

Extopus (www.extopus.org) is a Tobi Oetiker's new software product, a
universal front-end for various open-source systems. It's designed to
aggregate and display data from various sources, such as network
monitoring systems. Extopus contains plugin modules for SIAM and Torrus,
and allows for service-centric display (opposed to Torrus'
device-centric presentation).

SIAM represents the inventory data in a service-centric fashion:
customer contracts consist of services, and each service may contain
multiple physical objects, such as device interfaces. Also the user
privilege system in SIAM allows assigning visible contracts to the
front-end users. Extopus allows the end-user to log in and navigate
through its service hierarchy, and display the traffic graphs and
summaries which are pulled and proxied from a Torrus server.
