=head1 NAME

monitor - Torrus Monitor.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<torrus monitor> --tree=I<TREENAME> [I<options...>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command starts the Monitor process for the tree I<TREENAME>. By
default it forks into a daemon, sets the log output file to
F<@logdir@/monitor.TREENAME.log>, performs one monitoring cycle, and
sleeps until the next cycle is scheduled. In daemon mode the log file
can be reopened by sending it a SIGHUP signal.

Monitoring cycle scheduling is controlled by two variables whose values 
may be set in F<torrus-siteconfig.pl>:

=over 4

=item $Torrus::Global::monitorPeriod

Sets the period of the monitor run to a specified number of seconds. Default
value is 300.

=item $Torrus::Global::monitorStartShift

Controls the shift of the start of monitoring cycle. Monitor will run at
C<time() mod Period + Shift>, thus allowing the data to be updated during the
shift period. Default value is 15.

=head1 OPTIONS

=item B<--nodaemon>
