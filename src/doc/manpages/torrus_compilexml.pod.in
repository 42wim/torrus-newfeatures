=head1 NAME

@XFORM_compilexml@ - Torrus XML configuration (re)compiler.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<@XFORM_compilexml@> --tree=I<TREENAME> [I<options...>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command (re)compiles the Torrus's XML configuration for the tree(s)
I<TREENAME>. It does not require any other processes to be restarted
after the configuration is changed. Renderer's cache is automatically
flushed on on the next Renderer's run. Monitor automatically resets on
the next monitoring cycle. All tokensets in the given tree are
emptied.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--all>

Instructs to (re)compile configuration for all trees.

=item B<--nods>

Instructs to (re)compile non-datasource configuration only.

=item B<--noval>

Disables all validation of the XML configuration. This speeds up the
compilation up to 2 times, while adding a risk to end up with an
unusable configuration. In addition, the first initialization cycle of
Collector and Monitor in this case would be much longer.

=item B<--debug>

Sets the log level to debug.

=item B<--verbose>

Sets the debug level to info.

=item B<--help>

Displays a help message.
