=head1 NAME

collector - Torrus data Collector.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<torrus collector> --tree=I<TREENAME> [I<options...>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command starts the Collector process for the tree I<TREENAME>. By
default it forks into a daemon, sets the log output file to
F<@logdir@/collector.TREENAME.log>, performs one
Collector cycle, and sleeps until the next cycle is scheduled. In
daemon mode the log file can be reopened by sending it a SIGHUP
signal.

Collector cycle scheduling is controlled by two parameters defined
for each individual configuration leaf: C<collector-period> and
C<collector-timeoffset>. See the B<Torrus Configuration Guide> for more
details.

The number of OID (Object IDentifier) variable bindings sent by 
Collector is controlled by the datasource parameter C<snmp-oids-per-pdu>.
It is set to a default value of 40 in F<snmp-defs.xml>, and may be
overwritten at the host level.
