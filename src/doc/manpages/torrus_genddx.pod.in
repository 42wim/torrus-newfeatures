=head1 NAME

@XFORM_genddx@ - Generates SNMP discovery instructions file for 
@XFORM_devdiscover@.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<@XFORM_genddx@> --host=I<HOSTNAME> | --hostfile=I<HOSTFILENAME> \
[I<options...>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<@XFORM_genddx@> generates the SNMP discovery instructions file, which may
be later used as input for the B<@XFORM_devdiscover@> utility to produce the 
corresponding Torrus XML configuration file. The hostname(s) of router(s) to
be included in SNMP discovery must be specified either using the 
B<--host> (for a single router) or B<--hostfile> option.  In the latter
case the file I<HOSTFILENAME> must contain a space-separated list of router 
hostnames. Hostnames may have the form C<host:devname> where C<devname> is
a symbolic device name.

This utility is designed to be used only once, in order to generate
the discovery XML canvas, for futher manual editing. It generates only
basic set of parameters, and there are much more of those that you may
use to customize the discovery process.

More information is available in B<Torrus SNMP Discovery User Guide>.
