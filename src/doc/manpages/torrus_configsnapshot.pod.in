=head1 NAME

@XFORM_configsnapshot@ - Generates a configuration snapshot for a Torrus tree.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<@XFORM_configsnapshot@> --tree=I<TREENAME> [I<options...>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command generates a configuration snapshot from current
datasources for tree I<TREENAME>. The output is an XML file, ready for
compilation, representing all datasources, monitors and tokensets of a
given tree. The snapshot does not include view definitions. Templates
and file patterns are expanded inside the file. It does not require
any other XML configuration files, except for F<defaults.xml> and your
custom view definitions.

B<Warning:> C<configsnapshot> from Torrus release 0.1.5 will not work
correctly with databases from previous releases. Use release
C<0.1.4bf2> instead.  C<configsnapshot> utility from release 0.1.4bf2
does not preserve aliases.

This utility is useful in Torrus upgrade process. In case when RRD files
structure is changing in Torrus default templates, and user(s) demand to
preserve the historical data, the following steps could be done:

=over 4

=item *

Stop the collector and monitor processes.

=item *

Install newest Torrus software and do not run C<compilexml> immediately.

=item *

Create snapshots of the trees that you want to preserve for historical reasons:

  @XFORM_configsnapshot@ --tree=myrouters \
    --out=share/xmlconfig/myrouters-snapshot.xml

=item *

If needed, move the existing RRD files into different directory. Then
change the C<data-dir> parameters in the snapshot XML accordingly.

=item *

Create a new tree with only the snapshot file in it. Compile the tree.

=item *

At this stage, it is up to the user to decide wether to continue running the
collector and monitor daemons for this new tree. The old data may be preserved
for historical reference, and collector may be run with the newest tree
structure and definitions.
