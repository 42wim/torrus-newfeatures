Torrus Vendor Support List
  Introduction
    This document provides a listing of vendor devices and generic MIBs that
    are suppported by Torrus's SNMP discovery utilities and/or templates and
    other supporting files.

    All SNMP MIBs described below are supported through "devdiscover", the
    SNMP discovery utility. Where possible, the system contact, location,
    and interface descriptions are copied to the generated Torrus
    configuration.

  Generic SNMP MIBs
    * RFC1697 (RDBMS-MIB)
        Provides the database engine performance statistics. Tested with
        Oracle only.

    * RFC2662 (ADSL-LINE-MIB)
        ADSL DSLAM statitics and line status. Tested with Paradyne DSLAM.

    * RFC2670 (DOCS-IF-MIB)
        DOCSIS cable status and statistics. Tested with Cisco uBR.

    * RFC2737 (ENTITY-MIB)
        Used to retrieve information about chassis and temperature sensors
        in Cisco devices.

    * RFC2790 (HOST-RESOURCES-MIB)
        Server CPU, memory, and disk statistics. Tested with net-snmp and MS
        Windows.

    * RFC2863 (IF-MIB)
        Generic network interface statistics from "ifTable" and "ifXTable".
        Most servers and network devices support this MIB. Featuring custom
        vendor-dependent indexing and interface type/name filtering. Tested
        with many different vendors.

  Vendor-specific SNMP monitoring
    * Ascend MAX
        Provides statistics for analog and ISDN interfaces, and the total
        number of lines used.

    * Atmel wireless access points and bridges
        Privides link quality and traffic statistics for wireless devices.
        The discovery process would run very slow unless you specify the
        following parameter in the discovery instructions XML:

         <param name="only-devtypes" value="ATMEL"/>

    * Cisco CatOS
        Memory, CPU, and temperature information. Per-interface statistics
        may be limited to the ports with description only.

    * Cisco IOS
        Provides per-interface traffic statistics; CPU, memory, and
        temperature information; I/O buffer statistics; IPSec traffic
        information; SAA agents statistics; cbQoS monitoring (implemented in
        a separate plugin).

    * Cisco PIX Firewall
        Firewall performance statistics.

    * Compaq Insite Manager
        Temperature and memory health information statistics for Compaq
        servers.

    * Empire (Concord) SystemEDGE
        Provides lots of statistics and information that a SystemEDGE agent
        may provide about the server health and performance.

    * F5 BigIp Load Balancer
        In-detail traffic statistics.

    * Microsoft Windows 2000/XP
        Sets up proper interface indexing and provides FTP and HTTP server
        statistics.

    * NetApp.com storage products
        Storage arrays performance and health information.

    * NetScreen Firewall
        Firewall performance statistics.

    * Oracle
        Database engine statistics.

    * Paradyne GranDSLAM
        xDSL statistics and line status.

    * UCD SNMP and Net-SNMP
        Memory, CPU, and disk usage information.

    * Xylan ethernet switches
        Port indexing for OmniSwitch and OmniStack ethernet switches.
