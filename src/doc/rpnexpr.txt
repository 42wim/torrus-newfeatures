RPN expressions in Torrus
    In the Framework, RPN expressions are the superset of those in RRDtool.
    See the "rrdtool graph" manual at
    <http://www.rrdtool.com/manual/rrdgraph.html>.

  New functions added
    * NE
        Pops two arguments from stack, and pushes 0 if the arguments are
        equal, and 1 otherwise.

    * AND, OR
        These functions pop two arguments from stack, and push back the
        result of logical operation. Unlike C operators,

    * NOT
        Pops one value from stack and pushes 0 if the argument is nonzero,
        otherwise 1.

    * ABS
        Pops one value from stack and pushes the absolute value of it.

    * NOW
        Pushes the current time, in seconds since Epoch.

    * MOD
        Equivalent of "%", the modulo operator. In Torrus parameter value,
        percent sign is reserved for parameter substitution.

  Data access
    In certain context, the values of the datasources can be evaluated into
    RPN expression.

    The general format for data access is following:

      {FUNC@PATH(-OFFSET)}

    "FUNC@" specifies a special function to be performed on the data being
    accessed.

    For monitor expressions, "T@" returns the timestamp of the data source.

    For "rrd-cdef" leaf types and for "rrd-multigraph" datasource types, the
    following functions affect the graph shape: "AVERAGE@", "MIN@", "MAX@",
    and "LAST@". They cause the corresponding Consolidation Function being
    used when creating a graph.

    "PATH" specifies the relative name for the data source. If omitted, the
    current leaf value is taken. If starts with "/", the path is considered
    as absolute. Path starting with letter denotes the child of the parent
    subtree. Double dot ("../") in the beginning of the path is interpreted
    as current parent's parent subtree.

    "(OFFSET)" determines the time reference, as described in "rrdtool
    fetch" manual. In addition, the word "LAST" refers to the latest data
    timestamp available.

    "(OFFSET)" is currently supported in Monitor expressions only.
