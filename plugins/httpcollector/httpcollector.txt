Http Collector Plugin
  Introduction
    This plugin adds the http collector type. It can get and parse web pages
    using the GET method.

  Installation
    Unpack Torrus main distribution and the plugin in some directories. From
    Torrus distribution directory, run

      ./configure --with-plugins=../torrus-plugin-http-0.0.1
      make install

    After Torrus installation has finished, add the following lines to your
    torrus-siteconfig.pl file:

      push( @Torrus::Collector::loadModules, 'Torrus::Collector::Http' );
      push( @Torrus::Validator::loadLeafValidators, 'Torrus::Collector::Http' );

    That is all, now you can use the parameters described below in your XML
    configuration.

        search-items. A search-item takes the following form:

                lineNumber:/pattern/

        LineNumber my be a number or *, * means treat the whole web page as
        one single line. The pattern is a regular expression and must
        contain a (). The value between () will be replaced in the RPN
