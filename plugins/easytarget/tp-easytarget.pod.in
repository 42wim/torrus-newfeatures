=head1 EasyTarget, quick Torrus config generator

EastTarget is a Torrus plugin designed for those users who need
to add some specific SNMP OIDs to Torrus collector, without
having to edit the complex XML files. EasyTarget is a quick way to
add a few new objects without too much efforts.

=head2 Installation

Follow the Torrus installation guide for the main software installation.

Unpack the plugin distribution package in some directory:

  gzip -dc tp-easytarget-1.X.tar.gz | tar xvf -

Then run the Torrus plugin installation utility, pointing to the
unpacked plugin directory:

  torrus install_plugin tp-easytarget-1.X


=head2 Quick steps

EasyTarget accepts input files in Windows-style INI format. It is important
that the file extension is exactly ".ini". By default, the files are searched
in the current directpoy and then in F<@sitedir@/easytarget>.

The input file consists of sections, each representing a leaf or a subtree
of Torrus datasource tree. You define the default parameters at the top of
the file in global section, and then create a section for
each tree element that you want to define. Here is a minimalistic example:

 OUTXML = mydevices.xml

 [/EasyTarget/dev1]
 snmp-host = 10.0.0.1
 snmp-community = public
 snmp-object = 1.3.6.1.4.1.5655.4.2.2.1.1.1.1.1.1

 [/EasyTarget/dev2]
 snmp-host = 10.0.0.2
 snmp-community = public
 snmp-object = 1.3.6.1.4.1.5655.4.2.2.1.1.1.1.1.1

Here's a more complex example:

 OUTXML = mydevices.xml

 [/EasyTarget/Myrouter/]
 snmp-host = 10.0.0.1
 snmp-community = public

 [/EasyTarget/Myrouter/data1]
 snmp-object = 1.3.6.1.4.1.5655.4.2.2.1.1.1.1.1.1
 
 [/EasyTarget/Myrouter/data2]
 snmp-object = 1.3.6.1.4.1.5655.4.2.2.1.1.1.1.2.1

Next step is to feed the input file to EasyTarget:

 torrus et --in=mydevices.ini --verbose

Then you need to add the generated XML file to the tree by editing the
F<torrus-siteconfig.pl> file, and compile the resulting tree:

 torrus compile --tree=main --verbose

Now you can start the collector and Apache server if they aren't yet running.
If they were already running, you don't need to restart them.
