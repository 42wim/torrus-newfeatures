=head1 RRDfit plugin for Torrus

=head2 Introduction

The "tp-rrdfit" plugin introduces a new utility, "rrdfit", designed to
adjust your existing RRD files to an updated Torrus configuration. It
reads the RRD files from the file system, compares the DS and RRA
definitions with those in Torrus configuration, and applies the changes
if needed.

The utility relies on the RRD::Tweak perl module available from CPAN.


=head2 Installation

Follow the Torrus installation guide for the main software installation.

Install the RRD::Tweak Perl module from CPAN:

  perl -MCPAN -e 'install RRD::Tweak'

Unpack the plugin distribution package in some directory:

  gzip -dc tp-rrdfit-2.X.X.tar.gz | tar xvf -

Then run the Torrus plugin installation utility, pointing to the
unpacked plugin directory:

  torrus install_plugin tp-rrdfit-2.X.X


=head2 Usage


  torrus rrdfit  --tree=NAME [options...]
  Options:
    --tree=NAME     tree name
    --path=/PATH    [/] start subtree name
    --nodeid=X      NodeId of a start subtree
    --readonly      only report the changes, but do not apply them
    --backupdir=DIR directory for backup files
    --loss          allow data loss
    --nobackup      do not back up the old files
    --debug         print debugging information
    --help          this help message


Unless --readonly is specified, rrdfit will abort if a collector is
runnig for this tree.

By default rrdfit will walk the entire tree and apply changes which do
not incur data loss (such as adding or extending RRA, adding DS). All
changes related to data loss will be reported but not executed.

The --loss option enables the changes which cause data loss. This
includes reducing the size of RRA, deleting RRA, or deleting DS.

By default rrdfit saves backup copies of changed RRD files in the same
directory as the original files. The options --nobackup and --backupdir
would change this behavior accordingly.

Only a part of the tree would be processed if --path or --nodeid options
are specified.

The --readonly option allows you to see what is going to be changed
without changing any RRD files.

In any case, it is recommended to make a full backup of all RRD files
before using the utility.
